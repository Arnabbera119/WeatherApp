# Weather App

## Overview
This Weather App is a simple yet elegant application built using **React.js** and **Material-UI**. It provides real-time weather information by fetching data from the **OpenWeatherMap API**. Users can search for a city and view its current temperature, humidity, minimum and maximum temperatures, and a brief description of the weather. The application dynamically changes its background and icon based on weather conditions.

## Features
- Search weather information by city name.
- Displays temperature, humidity, min & max temperatures, and weather description.
- Dynamically updates the display with relevant images and icons based on weather conditions (e.g., hot, cold, rainy).
- Responsive design with Material-UI components.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**
- **Material-UI**
- **CSS (for styling)**
- **OpenWeatherMap API**
